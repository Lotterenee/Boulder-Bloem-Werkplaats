# Harness Context

This project was scaffolded from the
[`evolutionary-leadership/harness-claude-github-railway`](https://github.com/evolutionary-leadership/harness-claude-github-railway)
template repo (variant: **harness-claude-github-railway**) using GitHub's
"Use this template" button. The template added automated CI/CD
infrastructure with Railway preview environments, PostgreSQL, and
S3-compatible object storage, not application code. Understanding what it
set up helps you work with it instead of against it.

The template content itself is authored in
[`evolutionary-leadership/harness-forge`](https://github.com/evolutionary-leadership/harness-forge)
and synced from there into this template repo on every harness release.

## Architecture

### Branch naming drives everything

```
claude/<codename>-<sessionId>  ← you work here (random codename)
       ↓ first push: slug commit from set-feature-name.sh, or any code push
       ↓ (GitHub Action)
feature/<name>                 ← created automatically from dev
       ↓                         + Railway env + Postgres + Bucket provisioned
       ↓ (/mergedev)
dev                            ← PR auto-merged
                                 Railway env + Postgres + Bucket cleaned up
```

- The session branch starts with a random codename
  (`claude/<adjective-scientist>-<id>`). To get a meaningful name, Claude
  runs `bash .claude/scripts/set-feature-name.sh <slug>` as its first
  action; it writes `.harness-feature` and pushes.
- The feature name is resolved as: use the slug in `.harness-feature` if
  present and valid, otherwise fall back to the codename (the `claude/`
  prefix and `-<sessionId>` suffix stripped). See "Feature naming" below.
- Pushing to a `claude/` branch triggers the Action that creates/updates
  the corresponding `feature/<name>` branch.
- Each feature branch gets its own isolated Railway environment with a
  dedicated PostgreSQL instance and S3-compatible bucket, duplicated from
  dev.

### Feature naming

Feature branches and Railway environments are named after the work, not the
random session codename. The mechanism:

- **Source of truth:** a committed file `.harness-feature` holding a
  kebab-case slug. Claude sets it early via
  `bash .claude/scripts/set-feature-name.sh <slug>`, which sanitizes the
  input, writes the file, commits, and pushes.
- **Resolution (everywhere):** use the slug if `.harness-feature` is
  present and valid (`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,40}$`, and not `dev` or `main`),
  otherwise fall back to the codename. The shared resolver is
  `.claude/scripts/resolve-feature-name.sh`; the three workflows
  (`claude-to-feature-branch.yml`, `claude-mergedev.yml`,
  `feature-branch-railway.yml`) apply the identical check.
- **Slug-first, not rename-later:** the slug is set BEFORE the first push,
  so the feature branch and Railway environment are created with the good
  name from the start (Railway has no clean environment rename). The early
  build head start is preserved because the slug commit IS the first push.
- **Graceful fallback:** if `set-feature-name.sh` is never called, the first
  code push still creates `feature/<codename>` and provisions Railway under
  the codename. Naming is an improvement, never a requirement.
- **No leak to dev:** `.harness-feature` is removed by the mergedev workflow
  before the merge, so a future session cloned from dev never inherits a
  stale name. For this reason `.harness-feature` must stay out of
  `.gitignore` (the workflows read it from the commit).

**Where do I look for X:**

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Provisioning trigger | A `claude/` push (the slug commit, or first code push) |
| Deploy branch | `feature/<name>` |
| Ongoing deploys | Railway dashboard (Railway-native, not GitHub Actions) |
| CI checks | Only on the PR to `dev`/`main` |
| Current feature name | `bash .claude/scripts/resolve-feature-name.sh` |

### Signal files

- **`.pr-description.md`**: Committing this file to the repo root triggers
  the GitHub Action to create a PR from `feature/<name>` → `dev` and
  auto-merge it. The `/mergedev` skill writes this file for you. If the
  frontmatter contains `review: true`, the PR is created but NOT
  auto-merged (used by the `/review` skill). If `hotfix: true`, the hotfix
  workflow handles it instead.
- **`.release-description.md`**: Committing this file triggers the release
  workflow to create a PR from `dev` → `main`, tag a version, and create
  a GitHub Release. The `/release` skill writes this file.
- **`.railway-url`**: Written by the GitHub Action to the feature branch.
  Contains the Railway preview URL for this feature's environment.
- **`.harness-feature`**: A committed one-line kebab-case slug naming this
  feature, written by `set-feature-name.sh`. The workflows and shell
  scripts resolve the feature name from it (with a codename fallback). It
  is removed before the merge to dev (by `claude-mergedev.yml`) so the name
  never leaks onto dev and into the next session. Unlike the other signal
  files it must stay tracked (not in `.gitignore`), because the workflows
  read it from the commit.

### `.harness-version` configuration

The `.harness-version` file supports these fields:

```yaml
harness: harness-claude-github-railway
version: 0.3.38
repo: evolutionary-leadership/harness-forge
traits: nodejs, typescript, express
check: npm test && npm run lint
reviewers: teammate1, teammate2
```

- **`harness`**: variant identifier; matches the per-cell template repo
  this project was scaffolded from.
- **`version`**: harness version installed; used by `/harness-upgrade` to
  diff against the latest release.
- **`repo`**: the upstream forge repo (`evolutionary-leadership/harness-forge`),
  which hosts `VERSION`, `migrations/`, and `stacks/traits/`.
- **`check`**: CI command to run on PRs to dev. When configured, the
  `feature-branch-checks.yml` workflow runs this command, and mergedev
  uses `gh pr merge --auto` to wait for checks.
- **`reviewers`**: Default reviewers assigned when using `/review`.
- **`traits`**: stack-specific best-practice files installed under
  `.claude/traits/` and managed by `/harness-upgrade`.

**Prerequisites for CI checks:**
- Enable "Allow auto-merge" in GitHub repo settings (Settings → General)
- Add a branch protection rule for `dev` requiring the "check" status check
- Optionally add the same for `main` to gate releases and hotfixes

### Hooks

- **SessionStart**: Runs `.claude/scripts/session-start.sh` on every new
  session. On a `claude/` branch, it resolves the feature name and, if a
  matching `feature/<name>` branch already exists, merges previous work and
  shows the Railway URL. It no longer pushes an init commit: a fresh
  session just prints naming guidance. Provisioning happens on Claude's
  first push, ideally the `set-feature-name.sh` slug commit (see "Feature
  naming"). You do not need `/feature` to start; just describe what you
  want to build and Claude names the session before its first push.
- **PreToolUse (Write/Edit/Bash)**: Runs
  `.claude/hooks/prevent-em-dash.sh`, which blocks any write that contains
  a U+2014 em dash.
- **PostToolUse (git push)**: Runs
  `.claude/hooks/post-push-railway-url.sh` after every `git push`, which
  fetches and displays the Railway preview URL. The hook delegates its
  fetch/poll loop to `.claude/scripts/get-railway-url.sh`, so any time
  the URL is not yet available (provisioning runs longer than the hook's
  ~80s budget, or hook output was not visible in context) you can re-run
  the helper directly: `bash .claude/scripts/get-railway-url.sh`.

### Railway environments

Each feature gets a fully isolated Railway environment:
- Duplicated from the `dev` environment (same services and config)
- Includes its own PostgreSQL instance and S3-compatible bucket
- `DATABASE_URL` is auto-wired via Railway reference variable
  (`${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}`), so your app just reads `DATABASE_URL`
- Bucket credentials are auto-wired as environment variables (see below)
- Deployed automatically when the feature branch is pushed
- Cleaned up automatically (including Postgres and bucket) when the
  feature is merged
- Preview URL stored in `.railway-url` on the feature branch. The
  publishing step in `feature-branch-railway.yml` is idempotent (no-op
  when `.railway-url` already exists) and self-healing: any future run
  on a stranded branch will look up the existing environment and commit
  the missing `.railway-url`. Concurrent pushes to the same `claude/...`
  branch *queue* instead of cancelling, so a new push never interrupts
  a Railway GraphQL mutation in flight.
- Deployment triggers are self-healing too: every provisioning run
  re-checks the environment's deployment triggers and repoints any that
  still target `dev` at `feature/<name>`, then redeploys the app service
  so the running code matches the connected branch. This repairs
  half-provisioned environments (e.g. when `environmentCreate` returned
  a malformed response mid-fork) that would otherwise silently serve dev
  code on the preview URL.

**Why no GitHub Actions run shows up on the `feature/` branch.** This
trips up almost everyone the first time, so it's worth stating plainly:
the `feature/` branch is wired to Railway, but it does **not** run
GitHub Actions on every deploy. There are two distinct actors, and only
one of them is GitHub Actions:

1. **One-time provisioning (GitHub Actions).**
   `feature-branch-railway.yml` runs **once**, triggered indirectly off
   the `claude/` push (via `workflow_run: completed` of the
   "Create feature branch & merge claude/ into it" bridge workflow,
   gated on `startsWith(head_branch, 'claude/')`). It checks out
   `feature/<name>`, creates the Railway environment (duplicated from
   `dev`), points the Railway **deployment trigger** at the
   `feature/<name>` branch, wires `DATABASE_URL` and bucket credentials,
   and publishes `.railway-url`. That is the *entire* GitHub Actions
   involvement in feature deploys.
2. **Every ongoing build and deploy (Railway, not Actions).** Once the
   trigger points at `feature/<name>`, **Railway's own GitHub
   integration** watches that branch and rebuilds/redeploys on each new
   commit. These deploys run inside Railway and show up in the **Railway
   dashboard** (project → the feature's environment → Deployments). They
   never appear as GitHub Actions runs, because GitHub Actions is not
   what triggers them.

Two consequences that look like bugs but are expected:

- **No `workflow_run` on `feature/` pushes.** The bridge workflow pushes
  to `feature/**` using the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`. GitHub deliberately
  does **not** trigger downstream workflows from `GITHUB_TOKEN` pushes
  (this prevents recursive workflow loops), so even if a workflow were
  listening on `push: feature/**`, it would not fire. The Railway
  provisioning is reached via `workflow_run` off the bridge precisely to
  work around this.
- **An empty "Check status" on the feature branch is normal.**
  `feature-branch-checks.yml` runs only on `pull_request` to `dev`/`main`.
  A `feature/` branch with no open PR has nothing to report, so a blank
  or "expected" check status there is not a misconfiguration; CI runs
  when you open the PR (via `/mergedev` or `/review`), not before.

**Where do I look for X:**

| What | Where it happens |
|------|------------------|
| Provisioning trigger | A `claude/` push (bridge workflow, then `workflow_run`); GitHub Actions tab |
| Deploy branch | `feature/<name>` (the Railway deployment trigger points here) |
| Ongoing builds/deploys | **Railway dashboard**, the feature's environment (Railway-native, not Actions) |
| Preview URL | `.railway-url` on the `feature/` branch, or `bash .claude/scripts/get-railway-url.sh` |
| CI checks | Only on the PR to `dev`/`main` (`feature-branch-checks.yml`), not on the feature branch itself |

**Region default:** Every service in every environment (production, dev,
and every feature branch) defaults to **EU West (Amsterdam)**; nothing
lands in a US region. All three services are covered:

- **App + Postgres** are pinned to `europe-west4-drams3a` via the
  `SERVICE_REGION` env var. Without this pin, Railway places new services
  in US East (Virginia), on the opposite side of the Atlantic from the
  bucket. The pin is applied by the one-time `harness-railway.yml` (for
  production and dev) and by `feature-branch-railway.yml`, which pins both
  on first provision *and* in an always-run "Pin service region to Europe
  and redeploy" step so an environment that already existed (older
  harness, or a create run that died early) still gets corrected.
- **The object-storage bucket** is created in the `ams` region via the
  `BUCKET_REGION` env var. Only `harness-railway.yml` creates buckets
  (for production and dev). Feature environments fork the dev environment,
  so every feature bucket *inherits* the dev bucket's `ams` region. The
  bucket is **not** addressable through `project.services`, so
  `feature-branch-railway.yml` cannot read or re-pin a feature bucket's
  region; the dev bucket is the durable control. A bucket also cannot be
  moved after creation, so a dev bucket in `ams` is what guarantees every
  feature bucket is in `ams`.

To switch regions, change **both** knobs in **both** workflows so they
stay in sync: `SERVICE_REGION` (app + Postgres) and `BUCKET_REGION`
(bucket). Valid `SERVICE_REGION` values come from Railway's
`serviceInstanceUpdate` GraphQL docs (e.g. `us-east4-eqdc4a`,
`asia-southeast1-eqsg3a`). Existing services do **not** migrate
automatically; changing either value only affects services created after
the change, and a bucket already created cannot be moved at all.
**After a `/harness-upgrade`, re-check both values**: an upgrade can
overwrite these harness-managed workflows and reset the region defaults.

**Database migrations:** Each feature environment starts with an empty
database. Your migration tooling must handle creating tables from scratch.

**Seed data:** Production has `SEED_DATA=false` set automatically by the
harness setup workflow. Dev does NOT have this variable, and feature
environments inherit from dev, so they seed normally. Projects should
check `process.env.SEED_DATA === "false"` at the top of their seed script
to bail out early on production.

**Bucket environment variables:**

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME` | Globally unique S3 bucket name |
| `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` | S3 endpoint |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | S3 access key |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | S3 secret key |
| `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` | S3 region (e.g., `auto`) |

Use any S3-compatible client library. Each environment's bucket is
completely isolated, with no cross-contamination between feature, dev,
and production. Buckets are created in the `ams` (Amsterdam) region by
default (the `BUCKET_REGION` knob), matching the EU West service region
pin (`SERVICE_REGION`) described above. Production and dev buckets are
created directly; feature buckets inherit `ams` from the forked dev
bucket and cannot be re-pinned per feature (see "Region default").

## Managed trait files

Stack-specific best practices live in `.claude/traits/` as separate
managed files (e.g. `.claude/traits/nodejs.md`,
`.claude/traits/typescript.md`). These are fetched from the forge repo's
`stacks/traits/` directory and can be auto-updated via `/harness-upgrade`.

To install traits, add the trait names to `.harness-version`:

```
traits: nodejs, typescript, express, vitest, eslint, pnpm
```

Then run `/harness-upgrade`. It will fetch the matching trait files from
the forge and install them in `.claude/traits/`. On future upgrades, it
will show diffs and let you update to the latest best practices.

Add this line to your project's `CLAUDE.md` so the AI reads them:

```
Read `.claude/traits/` for stack-specific best practices before writing code.
```

Available traits and presets are listed in the forge repo's `stacks/`
directory.

## Migration system

Each harness version has a structured migration file
(`migrations/X.Y.Z.yaml` in the forge repo) describing what changed. The
`/harness-upgrade` skill uses these to:

- **Filter by relevance**: only show changes that affect your variant and
  traits
- **Categorize by priority**: REQUIRED (infrastructure), RECOMMENDED
  (traits), INFORMATIONAL (other)
- **Show context**: what changed and why, not just raw diffs

Migration files are auto-generated by the `harness-version-bump.yml`
workflow in the forge whenever a feature merges to `dev`. They are never
manually authored.

## Harness-managed files

These files are maintained by the harness and replaced on
`/harness-upgrade`. Do not edit them; your changes will be overwritten.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.github/workflows/claude-to-feature-branch.yml` | Merges `claude/` branches into `feature/` branches |
| `.github/workflows/claude-mergedev.yml` | Deletes Railway environment, creates PR from `feature/` to `dev`, and auto-merges (or opens for review) |

| `.claude/HARNESS.md` | This file |
| `.harness-version` | Version tracking |
| `.claude/traits/*.md` | Stack best practices (managed per `traits:` in `.harness-version`) |

**Note:** `harness-railway.yml` is a one-time setup workflow that
self-destructs after its first run. It is not part of ongoing upgrades.
It can be triggered two ways: manually via the Actions tab ("Run
workflow"), or by writing a one-line `.harness-bootstrap` file to the
`dev` branch (used by the harnesscompanion.com wizard via the GitHub
MCP server, which can write files but not dispatch workflows). The
final cleanup step removes both `.github/workflows/harness-railway.yml`
and `.harness-bootstrap`, so the trigger can never re-fire.

The cleanup commit (titled `chore: remove harness bootstrap files
(one-time use)`) carries the provisioned Railway URLs in its body in a
stable, grep-friendly shape:

```
production-url: https://<prod-domain>
dev-url: https://<dev-domain>
```

A bootstrapping Claude Code session (or the harnesscompanion.com setup
wizard) can fetch those URLs via `list_commits` on `dev` instead of
asking the user to copy them out of the workflow's Job Summary. Treat
this commit body shape as a contract: tooling parses it by line key.

After pushing the cleanup commit, the same step also retires the
one-time-use `RAILWAY_WORKSPACE_ID` repo variable (if it was set) and
deletes any stray `claude/*` and `feature/*` branches left over from
the bootstrap session. The bootstrap session does not run `/mergedev`,
so if it named a feature (via `set-feature-name.sh`) or pushed any
code, the resulting `feature/<name>` branch would leak with nothing
else to clean it up; doing it here keeps a freshly bootstrapped repo
tidy. Because the workflow self-deletes
beforehand, this branch cleanup can only ever run during first-repo
bootstrap, never against an established repo where those branches
would represent real work.

## Harness-provided starting points

The harness created these files as a starting point. You own them, so
edit freely to match your project. On `/harness-upgrade`, these are
diffed and you choose whether to accept upstream changes.

| File | What to customize |
|------|-------------------|
| `.claude/settings.json` | Add your own hooks and tool permissions alongside the harness-provided ones |
| `.github/dependabot.yml` | Add entries for your package ecosystems (npm, pip, Docker, etc.) |
| `railway.json` | Customize build commands, start commands, restart policy for your app |

The harness ships `.claude/settings.json` with an `env` block that sets
`API_TIMEOUT_MS=900000` and `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_RETRIES=15` to harden
sessions against stream idle timeouts. Keep these values (or raise them)
when you add your own keys; see "Avoiding stream timeouts" in
`claude-md-snippet.md` for context.

## Starter scaffold (write-once)

The harness ships a minimal Node + Express "it works" app so the Railway
pipeline has something to deploy on the very first push. These files are
**created once on init and never touched again** by `/harness-upgrade`:

| File | What to do |
|------|------------|
| `server.js` | Replace with your real app, or delete entirely if not using Node |
| `package.json` | Replace with your real manifest, or delete entirely if not using Node |
| `.gitignore` | Extend for your stack |

Concretely:
- If you edit any of these files, `/harness-upgrade` will **never overwrite
  your changes**.
- If you delete any of these files, `/harness-upgrade` will **never
  recreate them**. You can safely move to Python, Go, Rust, or any other
  stack: delete `server.js`, `package.json`, `.gitignore`, and update
  `railway.json`'s `startCommand` and `watchPatterns` to match your
  runtime.
- If a starter file is missing on a fresh scaffold (partial install), the
  next `/harness-upgrade` run will offer to create it from upstream.

## Project-owned files

Everything else belongs to the project. The harness does not touch:

- **`CLAUDE.md`**: Your project instructions. The harness provides
  `claude-md-snippet.md` as a starting point; copy what you need.
- **All application code**: Source files, configs, tests, etc.
- **Custom skills**: Any skill you add to `.claude/skills/` that isn't
  listed above.

## How to extend

### Adding a skill

Create `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`,
`description`). Custom skills are not touched by `/harness-upgrade`.

### Adding an agent

Create `.claude/agents/<name>.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`,
`description`, `allowed-tools`). Agents are autonomous specialists that
run in their own context via the Agent tool. Custom agents are not
touched by `/harness-upgrade`.

### Adding workflows

Prefer adding new workflow files in `.github/workflows/` over modifying
harness-managed ones. New files won't be touched by upgrades.

### Switching to Docker builds

Railway defaults to Railpack, which auto-detects your framework and
handles builds with zero config. If you need custom build steps (system
dependencies, multi-stage builds, binary compilation), create a
`Dockerfile` and update `railway.json`:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE",
    "dockerfilePath": "Dockerfile"
  }
}
```

## Variants

Two per-cell template repos currently ship from the forge:

| Variant | Repo | What you get |
|---------|------|--------------|
| `harness-claude-github` | [evolutionary-leadership/harness-claude-github](https://github.com/evolutionary-leadership/harness-claude-github) | Feature branches + auto-merge, no deploy target |
| **`harness-claude-github-railway`** *(this project)* | [evolutionary-leadership/harness-claude-github-railway](https://github.com/evolutionary-leadership/harness-claude-github-railway) | + Railway preview environments per feature with isolated PostgreSQL and S3-compatible bucket |

Switching from `harness-claude-github` to
`harness-claude-github-railway` is not an automated migration; it
requires re-scaffolding from the new template and porting your
application code over.

## Upgrading (same variant)

Run `/harness-upgrade` to check for version updates within your current
variant. The skill uses structured migration files from the forge
(`evolutionary-leadership/harness-forge`) to show you exactly what
changed, filtered by your variant and installed traits. See
`.harness-version` for current version info.

### Version numbering

Harness versions use semver (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`):
- **PATCH** bumps automatically on each feature merge to the forge's
  `dev` branch
- **MINOR** bumps are a developer decision for significant releases
- **MAJOR** is reserved for breaking architecture changes
